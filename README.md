# Extensive Diamonds

A Minecraft mod that adds more diamond types to Minecraft!

We all love diamonds in Minecraft - they protect us, help us attack the vast range of hostile mobs, and make us look epic! But don't you wish that there was more variety to diamonds in Minecraft?

**Extensive Diamonds** solves that! This mod adds three new regular diamond types to Minecraft - red, dark, and green - which generate right in your world just like regular diamonds. The mod also adds a special fused diamond, crafted very carefully using the Gem Charger block.

All crafting recipes shapes for tools and armor are like standard vanilla, just with the appropriate material in replacement of the default ones.

**This mod adds:**
- Four new swords
- One new toolset
- Ores and ore blocks
- A new painting variant
- Natural world generation
And more!

See the images section for the gem charger crafting recipe and the mod gallery showcasing the blocks and items!

**Note: This mod requires Fabric API**
